# Chat Application Using Django

>This is a file from index

We are going to use 'gevent-socketio' a Python package which can be installed using pip. On the client side we are going to use socket.io.js. We are also being careful about which versions of python packages we are using.

1. bullet 1 :)
2. this is madness from $\sqrt{a^2+b}$

## This is rather in the middle

This is one of the root of quadratic equation

$$ \frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $$

## Now, this is code

```python
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def run_madness(mellon, ryan):
    print('this is my name')
    img = cv.imread('./lena.jpg', cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    trails = int(raw_input().strip())
    for _ in range(trails):
        run_madness(mellon, ryan)

```
